### Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
This is a basic implementation of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The program uses ABAP's selection-screen elements to create a user interface and logic to determine the game's winner. The game alternates between Player 1 and Player 2, represented by "X" and "O". It checks for winning conditions after each turn and declares the winner.

## Usage
 - Execute the program in the SAP GUI.
 - Enter the names of Player 1 and Player 2 on the selection screen.
 - Click the "Proceed" button to start the game.
 - Players take turns clicking the buttons in the grid to place their mark ("X" or "O").
 - The program declares the winner when a player aligns three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
 - The game resets automatically after a winner is declared.
